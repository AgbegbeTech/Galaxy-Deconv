clarify Guassian additive noise: image simulation - give amounts of noise, for grid plot - put in physical units, defining SNR
compare to modern method: see plan below
make weights available and useable -- emphasize usability advantage: tutorial
overcomputing wrt systematic noise
variable line thickness on error bars?
aspect ratio on figures 
 
double check that shapenet (and other Nammour) comparison isn't immediate (no code, no weights, different metric), put note in figure caption - also, do PSNR comparison - "[citation] does not provide code or weights or include an ellipticity error vs SNR plot. However, we when compare their ellipticity error vs PSNR plot to our method (not shown), [we're good]"
ADMMnet, old one: digitize plots and drop into ours
for all 3: double check that we're all using reduced shear
