This folder holds the figures in the paper and the files that created them. The 5 figures in the paper are:

    [pipeline.jpg](pipeline.jpg)         Figure 1: An overview of the pipeline.
    [grid.jpg](grid.jpg)             Figure 2: An illustration of performance at multiple SNR levels.
    [err_snr.jpg](err_snr.jpg)          Figure 3: Average ellipticity errors at multiple SNR levels.
    [time_err.jpg](time_err.jpg)         Figure 4: Ellipticity error curve with respect to time at different SNR levels.
    [psf_err_cartoon.jpg](psf_err_cartoon.jpg)  Figure 5: The response curves of ellipticity error as a function of systematic errors in the PSF.

### Figure 1
This figure is create with Powerpoint (see [`pipeline.pptx`](pipeline.pptx)). The cartoon figures for the ground truth ([`gal_image.jpg`](gal_image.jpg)), PSF ([`psf_image.jpg`](psf_image.jpg)), observation ([`obs.jpg`](obs.jpg)), and reconstruction ([`gal_image.jpg`](gal_image.jpg)) are created by [`tutorials/image_simulations.ipynb`](../tutorials/image_simulation.ipynb).
