This folder holds the figures in the paper and the files that created them. The 5 figures in the paper are:

Figure 1 ([`pipeline.jpg`](pipeline.jpg)): An overview of the pipeline.

Figure 2 ([`grid.jpg`](grid.jpg)): An illustration of performance at multiple SNR levels.

Figure 3 ([`err_snr.jpg`](err_snr.jpg)): Average ellipticity errors at multiple SNR levels.

Figure 4 ([`time_err.jpg`](error_time.jpg)): Ellipticity error curve with respect to time at different SNR levels.

Figure 5 ([`psf_err_cartoon.jpg`](psf_err_cartoon.jpg)): The response curves of ellipticity error as a function of systematic errors in the PSF.

### Figure 1: ([`pipeline.jpg`](pipeline.jpg))

**An overview of the pipeline.** This figure is create with Powerpoint (see [`pipeline.pptx`](pipeline.pptx)). The cartoon figures for the ground truth ([`gal_image.jpg`](gal_image.jpg)), PSF ([`psf_image.jpg`](psf_image.jpg)), observation ([`obs.jpg`](obs.jpg)), and reconstruction ([`gal_image.jpg`](gal_image.jpg)) are created by [`tutorials/image_simulations.ipynb`](../tutorials/image_simulation.ipynb).

### Figure 2: ([`grid.jpg`](grid.jpg))

**An illustration of performance at multiple SNR levels.** This figure is created by ['grid_plot.ipynb'](grid_plot.ipynb).

### Figure 3: ([`err_snr.jpg`](err_snr.jpg))

**Average ellipticity errors at multiple SNR levels.** This figure is created by ['error_snr.ipynb'](error_snr.ipynb).

### Figure 4: ([`time_err.jpg`](error_time.jpg))

**Ellipticity error curve with respect to time at different SNR levels.**  This figure is created by ['error_time.ipynb'](error_time.ipynb).

### Figure 5: ([`psf_err_cartoon.jpg`](psf_err_cartoon.jpg))

**The response curves of ellipticity error as a function of systematic errors in the PSF.** This figure is created by [`psf_err_cartoon.pptx`](psf_err_cartoon.pptx). The line plot is created by [`psf_error.ipynb`](psf_error.ipynb) while the PSF cartoon bars are created by [`psf_cartoon.ipynb`](psf_cartoon.ipynb).
